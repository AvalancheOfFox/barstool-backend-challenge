# barstool-backend-scoreboard-challenge
This is the backend for the Barstool Sports takehome challenge. 

You can get the appropriate MLB and NBA json files from endpoints at /feeds/mlb or /feeds/nba. 

To run this project locally, assuming you've cloned it down already, simply run `node index.js` and your backend will be running. 

To test the end points, you can run either of the following commands in your terminal: 

`curl http://localhost:6969/feeds/mlb`
`curl http://localhost:6969/feeds/nba`
